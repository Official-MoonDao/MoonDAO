# Example cypress-split timings file
# This file is auto-generated after the first test run
# Format: spec file path : duration in milliseconds
# 
# cypress-split uses this data to distribute tests optimally
# across parallel containers based on their actual execution time
#
# After your first parallel run, a real .cypress-split-times file
# will be created with actual timing data
#
# You can commit this file to your repo for consistent CI performance
# or keep it gitignored and let each environment build its own timings
