                the world, regardless of their financial means, and Cobyâ€™s
                monumental flight sets the stage for what DAOs are capable of

                Program and learn more about some of the exciting stuff we've
                got in the works... MoonDAOâ€™s mission is to create a
                self-sustaining, self-governing colony on the Moon to act as a
                launch point for humanity to explore the cosmos. Yes, we're
                serious -- and the Moon parties are going to be epic.
