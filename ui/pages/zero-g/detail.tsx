            Welcome to the ultimate space experience, brought to you by MoonDao
            and Space for a Better World. This is your chance to be part of
            something truly groundbreaking and make a difference in the future

              We believe that space exploration is the key to unlocking a better
              future for all of humanity. That's why we're inviting you to join
              us on an unforgettable journey, and help us build a
              self-sustaining, self-governing settlement on the Moon that will
              act as a launch point for humanity to explore the cosmos.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mission is to create a more equitable and sustainable world,
              and we believe that the frontier of space is the greatest
              opportunity to achieve this. As a high profile individual who
              shares our values, we want to offer you the chance to be part of
              something truly special.

            Your journey will begin with a tour of the Houston Space Center,
            where you'll get to meet with two NASA astronauts who will be
            joining us on our mission to the Moon. They'll share their
            incredible stories of what it's like to live and work in space, and
            give you a glimpse into what's in store for you on your journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, it's time to take flight. Our zero gravity flight experience
            is unlike anything else you've ever experienced. You'll be
            weightless, floating freely in the cabin. And with MoonDao's
            cutting-edge experiments in the flight, you'll be part of something
            truly revolutionary.
          </p>
          <p>
            But this isn't just about the experience or a few experiments. We're
            inviting you to be part of our long term mission to the Moon. With
            your support, we can make this dream a reality, and help create a
            better world (and galaxy) for all of us.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that's not all. As a supporter of MoonDao and Space for a Better
            World, you'll have access to a community of like-minded individuals
            who share your passion for creating positive change in the world. We
            believe that by working together, we can achieve anything we set our
            minds to.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            So, are you ready to join us on this incredible journey? Let's make
            history together, and create a brighter future for all of humanity.

            just have some intergalactic jokes up their spacesuit sleeve!
