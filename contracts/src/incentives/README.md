# Retroactive Rewards

0. Current projects are submitted and uploaded to TableLand once approved.
0. On an ongoing basis, citizens may allocate their tokens on a percentage basis to the projects.
0. Citizens may also delegate their tokens to a representative to allocate on their behalf.
0. Allocations must sum to 100% and include a valid signature from the respective citizen.
0. Citizens may change allocation any time before end of quarter, and only the most recent allocation will be considered.
0. Citizens may not allocate to projects they are involved in, rather an algorithm will fill in the gap.
0. vMOONEY holders may then allocate to the citizen distribution they support.
0. At the end of the quarter, the tokens are distributed to the projects based on the allocations.


## TODOs

0. Design allocation page, including current list of projects, input forms for citizens to allocate, and current allocations/projects rewards.
0. Implement allocation page including signature and storage of allocations.
0. Define any relevant parameters for determining final allocations.
0. Implement the algorithm to fill in the gaps.
0. Implement calculation of rewards based on allocations, and display.

## Anti-Goals

0. Do not use snapshot. Everything is on MoonDAO.com
0. No expensive transactions. Citizens just need to sign messages.
