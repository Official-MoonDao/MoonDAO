[MoonDAO.com](https://www.moondao.com) is the hub for the Internet's Space Program, where users can become a MoonDAO member, obtain $MOONEY, stake to participate in governance, submit proposals, vote, read news and updates, dive into the documentation, and interact with the Marketplace for unique experiences such as the Ticket to Space sweepstakes or zero gravity astronaut training experiences. To get started, users can connect their Web3 wallet, or create one by email or social login, in order to interact with the MoonDAO smart contracts.
